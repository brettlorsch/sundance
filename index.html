        This is one of the finest homes in the Sundance Resort area. It is located less than one mile from the ski lifts, thus making it very accessible to the activities of the resort, yet far enough away to give you the privacy and quietness one would expect in the beautiful Rocky Mountains. Truly, a place to build memories that will last a lifetime.
